SMDesigner - Structure mutation designer

    SMDesigner makes mutation automatic for conserved RNA structure. 
    It makes minimum mutations to district structure which affect RNA's 
    function. SMDesigner work is based on the consences structure feature of RNA.
    SMDesigner selects the base pair to make mutation according to the number
    and position of covariation mutation, the length of the stem. Then it 
    makes two types of mutation for each sequence, one is distript mutation
    another is restory mutation.
